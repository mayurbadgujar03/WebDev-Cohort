# Let’s create a sample PRD for a **Digital Car Washing Centre** using HTML.

## Step 1 : Objective or Purpose

* Converting this offline **“Car washing centre”** into an online **“Digital car washing centre“**.
    
* Building an attractive HTML website for the car washing centre.
    
* Increasing the customers, accessibility and improve their experience.
    
* Decreasing booking queues.
    

## Step 2 : Scope

* A basic website with Location, Logo and Background images showing how we wash the cars.
    
* Website includes several pages like **Landing, Home, Services(with videos), Feedbacks, Contacts, Map(address or 2D image) etc**.
    
* Booking will be reserved via **direct phone calls** using contact page.
    
* No Payment integration needed.
    

## Step 3 : Features and Requirements

**P1 category (High Priority):**

* Location, Logo and background image must be attached to the Landing page and Home page
    
* What types of services will be offered (e.g. car washing, engine oil changes—no air pressure checks).
    
* Videos along with pricing details on the Services Page.
    
* Contact number, available hours, and the location in the Contacts page.
    
* In the Feedback page, display customer's feedback with previous work videos.
    
* For booking and cancelling appointment will be maintained through phone call.
    

**P2 category (Low Priority):**

* Payment through mobile banking.
    
* Online booking using Email.
    
* Showing slots in Real-time for tracking.
    

## Step 4 : User Stories or Use Cases

**As a customer (car owner), I want to:**

* View available services and prices online.
    
* Easily book slot with specific time.
    
* Modify or cancel slots on call.
    
* View my booking history and service preferences.
    
* Provide feedback on services.
    
* Explore exclusive online offers.
    
* Receive service recommendations based on my car.
    

**As a car washing center owner, I want to:**

* Manage schedules and availability.
    
* Track slots, cancellations, and no-slots.
    
* Update real-time booking requests and customer data.
    
* Communicate with customers effectively (slot reminders, offers, etc.).

## Step 5 : Technical Requirements

* HTML
    
* CSS
    
* JavaScript

## Step 6 : Design Requirements

* Logo should be simple, catchy.
    
* The logo should be in black and white.
    
* Dark theme would be preferred.
    
* The webpage should be optimized in both web and mobile.
    
* Videos must be relevant to the theme of the website
    

## Step 7 : Success Metrics

* Successful Registration.
    
* First slot booked via phone call.
    
* Served first customer, got from the website.

## Step 8 : Timeline

Timeline is simply that amount of time required to complete the project(e.g. 3 months).

# Conclusion

Now you know how much planning goes into a project before jumping into coding mindlessly. A **PRD(Product Requirements Document)** is just a **common-sense** written down.
